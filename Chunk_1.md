**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a pay-as-you-go cloud computing service that delivers computing power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources on demand through the internet. It offers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) as well as Platform as a Service (PaaS) (PaaS).

IaaS allows businesses to use Amazon Web Services instead of building and managing their own datacenter. AWS allows you to rent virtual machines (VMs) or real servers.

On the other side, Platform as a Service (PaaS) eliminates the need for your company to handle underlying platforms such as databases, streaming services, and so on.
