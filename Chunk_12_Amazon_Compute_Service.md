### Amazon Severless Application Repository

The AWS serverless application repository is a repository for serverless applications that is administered by AWS. It allows us to easily release code samples, components, and full apps for typical use cases such as online and mobile backends and data processing, logging, monitoring, IoT, and more.

### Benefits 

- Develop more powerful apps
- Easily manage applications
- Reuse without rebuilding existing app
- Ensure best practices

### Features :

- It allows developers to save and distribute reusable programs.
- It simplifies the assembly and deployment of serverless systems in powerful new ways.
- Because it is a serverless repository, it does not need to clone, develop, package, or publish source code to AWS before deploying.
