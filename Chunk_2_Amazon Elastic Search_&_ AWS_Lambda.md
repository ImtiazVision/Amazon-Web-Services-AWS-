**Amazon Elastic Search** is a service managed by amazon that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elastic Search clusters in the AWS cloud. 

**AWS Lambda**: This is a service that allows us to upload a function to AWS and pay for it each time it is performed or called.

We don't have to worry about the OS or the VM being managed. We don't have to do anything since Lambda takes care of everything. Consider a tax calculator, for instance. The code would be written by us in the conventional way. To deploy our code to the VM, we'll need to buy a virtual machine. Then there's the upkeep and management of the deployment. We don't have to pay for or manage the VM with Lambda because Amazon takes care of it.

**IAM (Identity and Access Management)** allows us to control who has access to which AWS services.
