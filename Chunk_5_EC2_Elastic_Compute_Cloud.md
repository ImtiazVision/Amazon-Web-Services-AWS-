**Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** is a cloud computing web service that provides resizable compute power.

**AWS EC-2** cuts the time it takes to get a new server instance up and running to minutes, allowing you to easily scale capacity up and down as your computing needs change.



If you wanted an app server or a database server in the old days, you had to hire someone. You'd need to talk to your developer first, size what you need in terms of cores, and then talk to your procurement staff, which might take 2+ months by the time the server arrives at your data center.



With **EC2**, you can do this with a single click. This also implies that, as a beginning, you won't have to pay for all of the equipment up front.


EC2 allows us to quickly deploy a whole computer in the cloud. The good thing about EC2 is that our computer will be extremely comparable to ours. If we can run our software on our machine, we can probably run it on EC2. Unlike other computation platforms (like Lambda), we don't have to modify our application to our host.
